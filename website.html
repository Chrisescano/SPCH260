        TSMC (TWSE: 2330, NYSE: TSM) created the semiconductor Dedicated IC Foundry business model when it was founded
        in 1987.
        In 2022, TSMC served 532 customers and manufactured 12,698 products for various applications covering a variety
        of end
        markets including high performance computing, smartphones, the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, and digital
        consumer
        electronics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Annual capacity of the manufacturing facilities managed by TSMC and its subsidiaries exceeded 15 million 12-inch
        equivalent wafers in 2022. These facilities include four 12-inch wafer GIGAFAB® fabs, four 8-inch wafer fabs,
        and one
        6-inch wafer fab – all in Taiwan – as well as one 12-inch wafer fab at a wholly owned subsidiary, TSMC Nanjing
        Company
        Limited, and two 8-inch wafer fabs at wholly owned subsidiaries, WaferTech in the United States and TSMC China
        Company
        Limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        In December 2022, TSMC announced that, in addition to TSMC Arizona’s first fab, which is scheduled to begin
        production of
        N4 process technology in first half of 2025, the Company has also started the construction of a second fab which
        is
        scheduled to begin production of 3nm process technology in 2026. At the same time, the Company continues to
        execute its
        plan for a fab in Kumamoto, Japan, with production targeted b

        vendors, we maintain an objective, consistent, and impartial attitude. We do not tolerate any form of corrupt
        behavior
        or politicking. When selecting new employees, we place emphasis on the candidates' qualifications and character,
        not
        connections or access.
